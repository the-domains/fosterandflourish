## Hey, I'm Tina Foster.

I teach yogis and meditative-types how to create practices that flow seamlessly with their real lives. 

I show people how the ancient traditions of yoga & meditation work and back my claims with modern psychological & scientific research.

I write books as well as design courses and other tools.

## You might work with me:

--online, digitally

--at your workplace 

--a retreat center

--your favorite yoga studio

--my private studio on Mission Street in San Francisco.

## I serve both individuals and groups-- including Fortune 500 companies, start-ups and non-profits.

Here's a link to a recent [Huffington Post article][0] about my work in large companies 

. 

For more than 3 years, I taught heart-centered meditation at Gap, Inc. headquarters, helped create a sister program in their NYC offices and appeared in a distance-learning program for their employees worldwide.

I specialize in creating programs for companies interested in alternatives to the usual Mindfulness-based programs usually offered in the workplace.

Here are some special things I made for my clients and people like YOU:

[Meditation-Mapping and Inner Life Design ][1]

[The (Forever) Beginner's Meditation Companion ][2]

[The Yoga Nidra Virtual Experience ][3]

[MeditationForNonMeditators.com][4]
